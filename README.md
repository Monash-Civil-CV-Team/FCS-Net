Automatic defects detection of steel infrastructures in structural health monitoring (SHM) is still challenging because of complicated background, non-uniform illumination, irregular shapes and interference in images. Conventional defects detection mainly relies on manual inspection which is time-consuming and error-prone. Traditional machine-learning based approaches have good recognition performance on the simple crack image while it requires intervention and empirical judgment by experts.
